    # Use Alice's session as the default for each request.
    # Note that each test (not request) has a copy of each fixture session.
    # If no fixture session is selected as the default, a local session with is created.
    # Variables in the test's default context can be accessed with the prefix "default".
    # Variables are evaluated in the context of the request's session.
    # This also makes all variables from the Alice fixture available as if they were local.
